## Attention

There may be multiple bridges for the same transfer path, and Helix selects one by default for the user, but the user is free to choose which bridge to use to complete the cross-chain in order to ensure that the costs and efficiency of the transfer are reasonable.

Once the transfer is submitted, it cannot be canceled, please double check the amount, target chain and other information before initiating the cross-chain transfer from your wallet.

The costs, arrival times, caps, etc. given in the hints are all estimates, and there will be some error between them and the actual values.
