# Relayer Client

Helix has open-sourced a JavaScript client, and you can find more information about it on their [GitHub](https://github.com/helix-bridge/relayer) repository. For specific configuration and deployment instructions, please refer to the README file in the repository. The README typically contains detailed guidelines on how to set up and use the client effectively.

Make sure to carefully follow the instructions provided in the README for a successful setup and deployment of the Helix JavaScript client.

Here's a brief overview of the steps for deploying a Relayer:

- **Deploy Indexer Service (You can skip this step if using Helix's public service)**: If not using Helix's public service, you need to deploy your own Indexer service. This might involve setting up and configuring an Indexer to index and provide on-chain data.

- **Download Relayer Source Code and Compile**: Download the Relayer's source code and compile it following the instructions provided in the project's documentation. Typically, this involves installing build tools, dependencies, and running compilation commands.

- **Configure Bridge Information for Providing Relay Services**: In the Relayer's configuration file, specify information about the bridges you want to interact with. This includes details about the source and target chains, such as chain types, connection details, contract addresses, etc.

- **Start the Relayer Client and Keep It Online**: Run the Relayer client and ensure it stays online, ready to handle forwarding transaction requests. Usually, Relayers listen on specific ports, awaiting requests from users.

- **Register the Relayer, Stake a Bond, and Set Fees**: Depending on the bridge's requirements, you may need to register the Relayer's identity on-chain, stake a certain amount as a bond, and set the fee structure. This ensures the credibility and availability of the Relayer.

Absolutely, it's crucial to ensure that the Relayer client is running smoothly and remains online before attempting to register as a Relayer. Failing to do so could result in penalties or other consequences, as reliability and uptime are typically important criteria for becoming and remaining a Relayer in most bridge ecosystems.

Relayers play a critical role in maintaining the smooth operation of cross-chain transactions, so they are expected to provide a high level of availability and responsiveness. Therefore, it's essential to thoroughly test and monitor your Relayer setup to ensure it meets the required standards before registering and actively participating in the bridge network.
